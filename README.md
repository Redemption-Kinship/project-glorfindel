# project-glorfindel
An integrated system to aid in the management of an MMO endgame guild.

## Development Notes
### Running the app
Since this is a node.js based app, you must have node.js installed.
> https://nodejs.org/en/

To run the app, first open a terminal from the root of the project directory.

Once open, type the following command to ensure all dependancies are installed:
```
npm install
```
Then, to run the app in developer mode, type the following command:
```
nodemon start
```
This will start the app in developer mode, and any changes made to files within the project directory will trigger an app restart.
